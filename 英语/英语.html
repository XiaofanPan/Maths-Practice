        <h1>THE COST OF DISHONESTY</h1>
        <div>David began studying in <span class="w">Germany<span class="e">n.德国</span></span> two years ago.
            The college was a little far from where he lived, so he had to take the subway every day.
            This clever student soon found it was easy to skip buying subway tickets, so he often went and returned without a ticket to save money.
            As a result, he had been caught with no ticket in the subway four times.
            But he never took them to heart. He thought what he should pay more attention to was his study. Finally he graduated with amazing academic achievements a month ago.
            Everyone, including himself, thought he would get a good job easily in Germany and had a bright future.
            He went to a big company confidently. But he wasn’t even allowed the chance for an interview. He couldn’t help telephoning the company to ask why they didn’t want him.
            The answer was simple:“we do not offer jobs to dishonest people in Germany!”
            We may get short-term benefits by dishonest means, but the truth will come out sooner or later and the cost is high.
            So remember, honesty is the best policy.
